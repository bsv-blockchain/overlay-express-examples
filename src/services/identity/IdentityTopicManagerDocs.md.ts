    The Identity Topic Manager is responsible for managing the rules of admissibility for Identity tokens.

    ## Admissibility Rules

  - The transaction must have valid inputs and outputs.
    - Each output must be decoded and validated according to the Identity protocol.
    - The certificate fields must be properly revealed and decrypted.
    - The signature must be verified to ensure it is valid.
    - Either the certifier or the subject must control the Identity token.

    For more details, refer to the official Identity protocol documentation.
